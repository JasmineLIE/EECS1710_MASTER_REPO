# [Ex 1: T.V Static](https://github.com/JasmineLIE/EECS1710_Exercise1)
A drawing exercise which focuses on events happening upon user interaction and disengagement.  White "stars" randomly generate around the screen alongside white text that reads "T.V Static".  If the mouse is presssed and dragged around to draw a line that follows the cursor, the stars will change its colours to red and the text will read "BUZZ BUZZ BUZZ!"
 
# [Ex 2: Crash Horizon](https://github.com/JasmineLIE/EECS1710_Exercise2)
A generative landscape exercise which focuses on multiple elements moving upon mouseclick.  The visual outcome is meant to generate the feeling of a pilot taking off through space.
 
# [E.x 3: PsyMatrix Clock](https://github.com/JasmineLIE/EECS1710_Exercise3)
A clock exercise which focuses on visual and audio elements to produce a cohesive demonstration and feeling.  Utilizing the clock class that calculates in real life time, a mock UI was created to display message notifcation banners with audio cues.  Upon the notification displaying, the user is able to interact with the messages and read their contents by pressing the assigned number keys.

# [Project 1: Flickering Boba](https://github.com/JasmineLIE/EECS1710_Project1_FlickeringBoba)
A creature project that focuses on interactivity between objects coming within proximity to one another.  When the water boba creature hits another bubble within its environment, that bubble will start to strobe colours and shrink in size.  Once the bubble fully shrinks, it will begin to expand.

# [Project 2: Fogton Cup](https://github.com/JasmineLIE/EECS1710_Project2_FogtonCup)
A one-button game project that focuses on incoporating a polished look with engaging player interaction.  The player is taken through a visual novel-type game that requires one button to go through.  They must read the character's dialogue to decipher which out of the five drinks would be the best one to serve--with some causing displeasure, satisfaction, or pleasure.  They're taken through a minigame within the game that is required to play with the same single button to proceed.  At the end, their drink decision affects the outcome.
